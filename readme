## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

**1. React-Quill and React 19:**  
React-Quill doesn’t support React 19, so we used React 18 for the client. 

**2. Soft Delete vs Hard Delete:**  
needed both archive (soft delete) and permanent delete. The backend now supports both, and the UI gives users both options.
